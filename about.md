Ahoj!

My name is Kry≈°tof Przeczek. I've always been passionate about mathematics, computer science, algorithms, physics, graphics, etc... since a very young age. So far, I've worked on various programming projects (most of which you can see over at my GitHub, though unfortunately some have been lost to time).

I also really enjoy doing graphics breakdowns and write-ups on computer graphics and physics simulation.

Other than that, I like sketching landscapes, tanks, and animals (birds and deer especially), playing my guitar, talking about how amazing The Last of Us is, or simply listening to music (post rock mostly). I also like just building stuff, like when I built my own crossbow (maybe I'll make a blog post on that at some point :p ).

As for the name of the blog, I just really love mapgies, and the number 428 just seemed... right?
