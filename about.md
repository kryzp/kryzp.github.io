Hello!

My name is Kry≈°tof Przeczek. I've always been passionate about mathematics, computer science, algorithms, physics, graphics, etc... since a very young age. So far, I've worked on various programming projects (most of which you can see over at my GitHub, though unfortunately some have been lost to time).

I also really enjoy doing graphics breakdowns and write-ups on computer graphics and physics simulation.

Feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:kprzeczek4@gmail.com">kprzeczek4@gmail.com</a>.
