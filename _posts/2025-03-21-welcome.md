Today marks the beginning of my blog, I intend to use this as kind of a journal with life updates, but mostly for notes, and writeups of anything interesting that I do. I'd like to keep the frequency of posts semi-consistent, but no promises, and I don't expect many people to read it anyway.

I made this blog using Jekyll and it's just using the default Minima theme (v3) with some colour / style changes, and I'm hosting it via GitHub pages, if anyone is curious.
