...this entire thing was inspired by **[CrossCode]()** (which is an amazing game by the way go play it), where they have some sort of pseudo 3D level height system. This seemed so cool to me, because you get the best of both worlds - the retro look of 2D games with benefit of the extra depth you get by having an extra dimension to play with, at the cost of some visual ambiguity in depth (which is why I believe RadicalFishGames' next project is just fully in 3D).
