I am left handed.

I'm pretty proud of it and all (particularly great for sports :) ), but one annoying problem is that it doesn't lend itself nicely to handwriting. I'm sure many of you are familiar with lefties being called "silver surfers" because of the amount of smudging that occurs when using pencil lead, but the smudging applies to pen inks as well. Fountain pens are even worse due to the water-based nature of the ink leading to easy smuding and long drying times.

That being said most of these issues can be rectified by just holding your hand underneath the text rather than to the side or above it.

This works, mostly, and especially well with pencils and gel pens that offer little resistance when writing. It also gives your handwriting a nice and unique (at least in my opinion) left slant.

However, fountain pens get tricky. They don't use a rollerball approach to press the ink onto the paper, nor do they smoothly layer material onto it (graphite). Instead, they rely on a capillary effect to drain the ink rezevoir onto the paper. This means that writing with them feels a lot more different since you're literally moving a solid metal pointer over the paper.

However, this poses challenges for writing with my left hand because unlike right handed, where you're moving the pointer "away" from the paper, you're instead pushing the pointer "into" the paper and cutting into it. This causes snagging, and it becomes difficult to maintain a consistent script.

Finally, due to what I can only assume are minute orientation changes between my left and right hand, the line thickness is generally far thinner on my left hand than my right. Combined with the extra resistance, it makes my left handed *fountain pen* cursive has a weird "compressed" look, like someone squished it along the x-axis in photoshop.

You can always take the DaVinci approach and write in reverse from right to left, which I actually have learned how to do, but it doesn't exactly make it easy for others to read your handwriting :/.

Eventually, I decided to just bite the bullet and learn how to write with my right hand. This came with the added benefit that I've now got insurance in case anything happens to either hand thanks to the better fine-motor skills. I'm aware that I'll probably never get "as good" motor skills on my right hand due to the nature of biology... or something. But it's certainly good enough for cursive handwriting since I only really needed to get good at drawing a finite set of symbols at a consistent tolerance and speed.
