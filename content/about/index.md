Ahoj!

My name is Kryštof Przeczek. I've always been passionate about mathematics, computer science, algorithms, physics, graphics, etc... since a very young age. So far, I've worked on various programming projects (most of which you can see over at my [GitHub](https://github.com/kryzp), though unfortunately some have been lost to time).

I also really enjoy doing graphics breakdowns and write-ups on computer graphics and physics simulation.

Other than that, I like sketching landscapes, tanks, animals (birds especially), playing my guitar, playing poker, talking about how amazing The Last of Us is, or simply [listening to music](/about/music/index.md). I also like just building stuff, like when I built my own crossbow.

As for the name of the blog, I just really love mapgies, and the number 428 just seemed... right?
