Ahoj!

My name is Kryštof Przeczek. I am currently a Computer Science student studying in the UK. This is my blog where I talk about random things that I find interesting or cool[^1], so thanks for visiting!

I've worked on various programming projects (most of which you can see over at my [GitHub](https://github.com/kryzp), though unfortunately some have been lost to time).

My topics of interest include:

- Game Development
- Physics Simulation
- Rendering / Graphics Programming
- Sketching Landscapes, Military Hardware and Animals (birds, especially)
- Poker
- Playing Guitar
- [Music](/music/)
- Building cool stuff (like when I [built my own crossbow](/posts/how-i-built-a-crossbow/))

Feel free to contact me at [kprzeczek4@gmail.com](mailto:kprzeczek4@gmail.com).
